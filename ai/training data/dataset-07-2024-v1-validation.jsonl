The goal was to see if Contentful could support a web application with content posting, liking, and commenting features. The idea was to allow customers to integrate these social network-like features into their websites without needing a huge budget, thus enabling collaboration among users. This solution is especially useful for companies, such as fashion brands hosting events, where attendees can register activity and collaborate. For this project, John used Next.js with React, along with SSR for server-side rendering, AuthJS for authentication, and Contentful Management API. Instead of using the Contentful SDK, John opted for the Management API due to issues with the SDK clashing with SSR features. You can check out the repository here: <a href='https://github.com/johnpino/social-network-contentful' target='_blank'>[GitHub Repository]</a>."}]}
