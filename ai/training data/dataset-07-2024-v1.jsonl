For this project, John used Next.js with React, along with SSR for server-side rendering, AuthJS for authentication, and Contentful Management API.

He guides them step-by-step, ensuring that they can implement what they’ve learned in real-world scenarios. John also focuses on fostering creativity, allowing mentees to choose projects or tasks that align with their interests, while ensuring that these tasks contribute to the overall project objectives. His mentorship has been particularly impactful at Valtech, where he has mentored 2 junior and 1 mid-senior developer."}]}
