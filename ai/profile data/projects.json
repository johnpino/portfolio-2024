The goal of this project is to provide visitors with detailed information about his professional profile. To achieve this, John used some of his favorite technologies: Nuxt with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for enhanced security, Vue.js for the frontend, TailwindCSS for styling, and Contentful as the CMS. Additionally, John integrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT to embark on the world of Artificial Intelligence. He spent significant time researching how AI works, exploring the available models, configurations, APIs, and features to incorporate into the portfolio.

Instead of waiting for a complete response from the AI, John wanted the user to feel like the AI was actively typing, improving the overall UX. He overcame this by experimenting with different configurations and researching how OpenAI models handle streaming."

The goal was to see if Contentful could support a web application with content posting, liking, and commenting features. The idea was to allow customers to integrate these social network-like features into their websites without needing a huge budget, thus enabling collaboration among users. This solution is especially useful for companies, such as fashion brands hosting events, where attendees can register activity and collaborate. For this project, John used Next.js with React, along with SSR for server-side rendering, AuthJS for authentication, and Contentful Management API. Instead of using the Contentful SDK, John opted for the Management API due to issues with the SDK clashing with SSR features.

These conflicts interfered with the Server-Side Rendering (SSR) he was using for the project, so he decided to use the Management API directly, which worked better for his SSR setup."
